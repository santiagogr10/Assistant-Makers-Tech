        say that given the purchase history, give the user recommendations for products that are highly recommended, recommended and not recommended.
        and explain why each product is recommended or not recommended.
        explain that the recomenendations are based on the purchase history.
        ----

        ## Highly Recommended:
        - [Product 1]: [Brief reason with specific details about brand/category match]
        - [Product 2]: [Brief reason with specific details about brand/category match]

        ## Recommended:
        - [Product 1]: [Brief reason explaining the related category or complementary use]
